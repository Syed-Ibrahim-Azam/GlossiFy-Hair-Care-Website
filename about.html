          <h2>Why We Started glossiFI</h2>
          <p>
            glossiFI was born out of a simple but powerful idea — that everyone deserves to feel confident in their
            natural hair. We saw a gap in the market for clean, honest, and inclusive haircare that truly works without
            compromise. Our founders, passionate about wellness and beauty, started glossiFI to bring transparency and
            quality to an industry filled with empty promises.
